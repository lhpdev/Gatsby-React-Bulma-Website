of the things you should know about using Even, a service provided by Even Responsible Finance, Inc. We’ve tried to make it as clear \n      and straightforward as possible, because that’s how we’d want to be treated. We last updated it on August 22, 2018. If you find anything in here confusing, \n      please let us know what you think: support@even.com.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      PLEASE NOTE: AS SET OUT BELOW IN THE DESCRIPTION OF “EVEN SUBSCRIPTION FEES” AND ANY RELEVANT EMPLOYER ADDENDUM, DIFFERENT TERMS MAY APPLY TO YOU IF YOU \n      ACCESS EVEN THROUGH AN EMPLOYER.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Acceptance of Terms and Conditions</h2>\n      <p>\n      By signing up for Even, using the Even application or visiting the Even website (www.even.com), you are saying you understand and agree to the things we’ve \n      explained in this document. You’re also agreeing to our privacy policy (www.even.com/privacy). If you don’t accept the terms and conditions contained in this \n      document (the “Basic Agreement” or the “Basic Terms”), we aren’t able to let you use Even, and simply ask that you delete the app from your phone.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Arbitration Provisions</h2>\n      <p>\n      We also need to ask that you please read these terms carefully, including the section labeled “Arbitration”, “Arbitration Restrictions” and “Exceptions to \n      Informal Negotiations and Arbitration”. These sections limit Even’s liability to you, and require individual arbitration for legal disputes between you and Even. \n      If you have questions about these sections, or any part of this Basic Agreement, get in touch! We’ll be happy to help. support@even.com.      \n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">The Even Basic Service</h2>\n      <p>\n      Even seeks to help you build a budget that helps you plan for upcoming bills and meet savings goals. This financial management service is known as “Even Basic.”      <br />\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Information from Third Party Sites</h2>\n      <p>\n      To provide Even Basic, Even connects to your bank or credit union account to retrieve your account transaction history. We use your transaction history to \n      determine your income and expenses. Accordingly, when you sign up for Even, we ask you to sign into your bank or credit union account.      \n      <br />\n      <br />\n      You may also direct Even to retrieve your earned but unpaid net wages, your upcoming employment schedule, and other information maintained by third-parties \n      with which you have relationships, maintain accounts or engage in financial transactions (“Account Information”). Even works with one or more third-party service providers, \n      to access this Account Information. By enrolling in Even Basic, you authorize Even to access this information maintained by identified third parties, on your behalf as your \n      agent, and you expressly authorize such third parties to disclose your information to us.      \n      <br />\n      <br />\n      By agreeing to these Basic Terms, you are also agreeing that you are responsible for keeping your passwords and usernames for this Account Information secure, and for keeping \n      those passwords and usernames up to date in the Even app. Even does not review the Account Information for accuracy, legality or non-infringement, and Even is not responsible\n      for your Account Information or products and services offered by or on third-party sites. You can read more about who we work with in our privacy policy (www.even.com/privacy).\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Even Subscription Fee</h2>\n      <p>\n      When you sign up for Even Basic, you agree to pay a regular fee for a subscription to Even Basic (the “Even Basic Fee”). In certain cases, your employer may pay part of,\n      or all of, the Even Basic Fee. Your employer may also enable you to pay the Even Basic Fee via a payroll deduction. In these cases, you will need to authorize this deduction \n      in coordination with your employer.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      For as long as you are subscribed to Even Basic, we will debit your account, invoice your employer for the regular Even Basic Fee, or, if you are paying the fee via a payroll \n      deduction, we will coordinate with your employer to receive the payments that you authorize. Should you stop working for an employer that pays the cost of using Even Basic ,\n      your subscription will be terminated unless you choose to enroll in Even Basic at your own expense or through your new employer. If you enroll in Even Basic and your employer\n      does not pay part of, or all of the Even Basic Fee (as set out in the relevant employer addendum), we will debit your account at the beginning of your subscription and on each \n      month thereafter unless and until you cancel. We will automatically charge you for the Even Basic Fee each month on the 30th calendar day following the commencement of your membership.      \n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Earned Wage Access</h2>\n      <p>\n      Even also allows qualified users to access “Instapay,” a service that enables you to obtain earned wages prior to payday (each, an “Earned Wage Access” or “EWA”). Instapay is \n      part of Even’s premium service (“Even Plus”), which provides additional value-added services to certain users for an additional subscription fee (the “Even Plus Fee”). While Even\n      Plus allows you to review the hours you’ve worked, analyze available budget and obtain a holistic perspective of your finances before requesting an EWA, you may also request an\n      EWA without enrolling in Even Basic or Even Plus. To do so, you must be employed by an employer with whom Even has partnered and have created an Even account. If you fulfill these\n      preliminary criteria, you may request up 50% of your then available net earned wages for the pay period at the time of your request.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      You must also fulfill some additional requirements.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      First, you must be 18 years or older. Second, you must have an account in your name, at a United States-based bank or credit union that issues you a debit card (some types\n      of prepaid debit cards also work). Third, you must have a current source of income that you regularly deposit into this account. Finally, you must have a smartphone with a \n      data plan and location services (GPS). You can read more about how we use data from your smartphone in our privacy policy (www.even.com/privacy). Requesting an EWA does not \n      require a check of your credit score.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      There are a few reasons we might not be able to let you obtain an EWA. These include:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>If you do not get paid by direct deposit.</li>\n        <li>If you have previously received an EWA but not repaid it.</li>\n        <li>If your bank account is currently or was very recently overdrawn or otherwise not in good standing.</li>\n        <li>If you recently changed the routing of your direct deposit paychecks.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n      To request an EWA without enrolling in Even Basic or Even Plus, you may send a written request to: Even Responsible Finance, Inc. ATTN: EWA Request 1440 Broadway 5th \n      Floor Oakland, CA 94612      \n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The request must include your first and last name, your phone number and email address, your bank account number and routing number associated with your Even account and into which\n      you receive direct deposit, a copy of your most recent paystub verifying the hours worked and associated earnings, and your work schedule for the current pay period. Failure to\n      provide correct and complete information may make it impossible for Even to provide you with an EWA. In addition to the information contained in this request, you must fulfill \n      all other eligibility requirements for receiving an EWA as outlined above. Any EWA you receive will be recouped by Even directly from your bank account on your next scheduled payday.\n      We do not charge any interest for this EWA. See “Your Authorization for ACH Debits and Credits” Section below for additional information regarding repayment.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Even Savings</h2>\n      <p>\n      Even Savings is also part of Even Basic and is designed to help you save money. To utilize Even Savings, you must have created an Even account and connected the bank account\n      where you receive your direct deposit paycheck. Through the app, eligible users may elect to turn on one of several savings mechanisms. In accordance with your instructions,\n      Even will keep track of the funds you earmark for Even Savings and, unless otherwise detailed in the relevant Employer Addendum, Even will transfer these funds from your Bank\n      Account to a custodial bank account held by Even for the benefit of its customers (the “Savings Cushion”) on your next scheduled payday. See “Your Authorization for ACH Debits\n      and Credits” Section below for additional information regarding this transfer.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      You may not use the funds in the Savings Cushion to make purchases, withdraw cash, transfer funds to third parties, or for any other purpose. In addition, please note that you\n      will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds in the Savings Cushion. You irrevocably transfer and assign to Even any and all rights that you may have to any interest\n      that may accrue on funds held in the Savings Cushion. This assignment applies only to interest earned on the funds held in the Savings Cushion, and nothing in these Basic Terms\n      grants Even any rights to the principal of the funds held in the Savings Cushion. Any funds moved to the Savings Cushion will remain there until you instruct us to transfer any\n      or all of your funds from the Savings Cushion to your Bank Account by submitting a request within the Even app. We will generally transfer the requested funds from the Savings \n      Cushion to your Bank Account within two business days of when we receive your request. It is important to know the amount of available funds in the Savings Cushion before \n      instructing us to transfer funds from the Savings Cushion to your Bank Account. If you do not have sufficient available funds in the Savings Cushion to cover the amount of the \n      requested transfer, your request for the transfer will be declined. We may also transfer funds from the Savings Cushion to your Bank Account without notice to you upon the closure,\n      cancellation, or termination of your Even account as described below.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Your Authorization for ACH Debits</h2>\n      <p>\n      If your employer does not pay the Even Basic Fee or if your employer pays only a portion of the Even Basic Fee, you agree to pay Even the Even Basic Fee or any remainder \n      of the Even Basic Fee as applicable.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      By signing up for Even Basic and agreeing to these Basic Terms, you authorize Even to electronically debit your designated deposit account at your designated depository financial\n       institution (your “Bank Account”) (and if necessary, electronically credit your Bank Account to correct erroneous debits) for payments due to us (the monthly Even Basic Fee, and\n        for eligible users, repayment of EWAs) and funds you instruct us to transfer to the Savings Cushion, via ACH as outlined in these Basic Terms. If Even is unsuccessful in debiting\n         your Bank Account for any of these funds and this default is not cured within ten (10) business days, your access to Even Basic will be suspended.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      You acknowledge that the electronic authorization contained in this Section represents your written authorization for ACH transactions as provided herein and will remain in full \n      force and effect until you notify Even that you wish to revoke this authorization by calling (510) 852-9149 or emailing support@even.com. You must notify Even at least three (3) \n      business days before the scheduled debit date of any ACH transaction from your Bank Account in order to cancel this authorization. When you call or email, please include the name \n      and telephone number associated with your Even account. Failure to provide correct and complete information may make it impossible for Even to stop withdrawal of the preauthorized\n      ACH transaction. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Even from and against any loss incurred as a result of its withdrawal of a preauthorized ACH transaction from your Bank \n      Account if any of the information relied upon in the stop payment order is incorrect or incomplete or as a result of its failure to withdraw a preauthorized ACH transaction for \n      which a valid stop payment order is in effect. If you have followed the instructions in this section to notify Even of your desire to revoke ACH authorization at least three (3)\n      business days before the scheduled debit date, Even will be liable for your losses or damages directly caused by our failure to stop any preauthorized ACH transaction. If we do \n      not receive notice at least three (3) business days before the scheduled debit date, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to cancel the debit transaction. However, we assume\n      no responsibility for our failure to do so.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      If Even cannot recoup the EWA balance from your Bank Account, Even will not pursue any legal claim against you but you will be prohibited from obtaining another EWA from Even.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Even is not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, or insufficient fund charges (including finance charges, late fees, or similar charges) that result from your\n      failure to maintain a balance or available credit in your Bank Account sufficient to meet your financial obligations (i.e., Even Basic Fees, repayment of EWAs, or funds you instruct\n      us to transfer to the Savings Cushion).\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Please note that we do not charge interest on any outstanding EWA balance and you will only be required to repay the exact amount of the balance. We will not sell the ability to \n      collect on your outstanding balance to a collections agency. We also will not report your outstanding balance to a credit bureau, or use it to hurt your credit score. However, in \n      the event of fraud, misrepresentation, or other illegal activity, we will use the legal options available to us in order to collect the money you owe us.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      In addition to any of your other representations and warranties in these Basic Terms, you represent that: (a) your browser is equipped with at least 128-bit security encryption; \n      (b) you are capable of printing, storing, or otherwise saving a copy of this electronic authorization for your records; and (c) the ACH transactions you hereby authorize comply with\n      applicable law.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Cancelling your Even Account</h2>\n      <p>\n      You can cancel your subscription to Even Basic or close your Even account at any time by emailing Even at support@even.com. Upon cancellation or closure, you will not be responsible\n      for any additional Even Basic Fees, but you will be expected to pay back any EWAs you owe to Even.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Just like you have the right to cancel, we have the right to cancel your use of Even Basic. We may terminate this Basic Agreement or suspend or terminate your use of the application \n      for any reason at any time upon notice to you. For example, this can happen if we find out you are using Even Basic in a way that violates this Basic Agreement. In the event of cancellation, Even may suspend or close your Even account. We will inform of our decision via in-app notification, and you can always talk to our support team if you have questions. You agree that Even will not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to Even Basic.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Upon the cancellation, closure or termination of your Even account by you or by us, we will transfer the funds in the Savings Cushion, if any, to your Bank Account. If your Bank Account\n      is closed or we are otherwise unable to transfer the funds in the Savings Cushion to your Bank Account, we will send you a check for the amount of the funds to you at your street address\n      in our records.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      If you do not use the Even app for a certain period of time, applicable law may require us to report your funds in the Savings Cushion as unclaimed property. If this occurs, we may try\n      to locate you at the address shown in our records. If we are unable to locate you, we may be required to deliver any funds in the Savings Cushion to the applicable state as unclaimed \n      property. The specified period of time to report and deliver funds to a state varies by state, but usually ranges between two and five years.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Ok, that’s all we have to say about getting started with Even. We also have to say a few things that guide your use of Even and protect Even – so a lot of the rest of this is more about\n      us than you. It also, unfortunately, contains more legal language.

We may terminate this Agreement or suspend or terminate\n      your use of the application for any reason at any time upon notice to you. For example, this can happen if we find out you are using the Personal Financial Management Service in a \n      way that violates this Agreement. In the event of cancellation, Even may suspend or close your Even account. We will inform of our decision via in-app notification, and you can \n      always talk to our support team if you have questions. You agree that Even will not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Personal Financial\n      Management Service.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Ok, that’s all we have to say about getting started with Even. We also have to say a few things that guide your use of Even and protect Even – so a lot of the rest of this is more about\n       us than you. It also, unfortunately, contains more legal language. So, if you have questions about these sections, you can always email us directly at support@even.com.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Your Use of Even Content:</h2>\n      <p>\n      To start, we need to define a couple of words we will use in this part of the Basic Agreement – the term “Services” includes the websites, services, features, content or applications\n      offered by Even Responsible Finance, Inc. as part of Even Basic, and “Content” includes any information, data, text, images, content, materials, software, and features generated, \n      provided or otherwise made accessible on or through the Services.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Subject to the terms of this Basic Agreement, we grant each user of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use (i.e., to download \n      and display locally) Content solely for purposes of using the Services. Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any Content for other than purposes of using the\n      Services is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from us. You may not sell, license, rent, or otherwise use or exploit any Content for commercial use or in any way \n      that violates any third party’s rights.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      We reserve the right (but do not have any obligation) to remove or block any Content from the Services or to remove, edit or modify any Content in our sole discretion, at any time,\n      without notice to you and for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if we \n      are concerned that you may have violated this Basic Agreement), or for no reason at all.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Even Rules of Conduct:</h2>\n      <p>\n      To protect Even, we need to define some rules that govern how you can use the Services and Content. As part of these rules, You promise not to: (i) take any action that imposes or\n      may impose (as determined by us in our sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our (or our third party providers’) infrastructure; (ii) interfere or\n      attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Services or any activities conducted on the Services; (iii) bypass, circumvent or attempt to bypass or circumvent any measures \n      we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Services (or other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to the Services); (iv) run any form of auto-responder or “spam” \n      on the Services; (v) use manual or automated software, devices, or other processes to “crawl” or “spider” any page of the Site; (vi) harvest or scrape any Content from the Services;\n      or (vii) otherwise take any action in violation of our guidelines and policies.

You are responsible for all of your activity in connection with \n      the Services. You must not (and must not permit any third party to) either (a) take any action or (b) upload, download, post, submit or otherwise distribute or facilitate distribution\n      of any Content on or through the Service that:\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>is unlawful, fraudulent or deceptive;</li>\n        <li>you know is false, misleading, untruthful or inaccurat;</li>\n        <li>infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity or other right of any other person or entity or violates any law or contractual duty;</li>\n        <li>contains software viruses or any other computer codes, files, or programs that are designed or intended to disrupt, damage, limit or interfere with the proper function of\n        any software, hardware, or telecommunications equipment or to damage or obtain unauthorized access to any system, data, password or other information of ours or of any third party;</li>\n        <li>impersonates any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives; or</li>\n        <li>includes anyone’s identification documents or sensitive financial information, except as explicitly permitted under this Basic Agreement.</li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>\n      We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process \n      or governmental request, (ii) enforce this Basic Agreement, including investigation of potential violations of it, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical \n      issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or the public.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Disclosure and Consent to Electronic Communications:</h2>\n      <p>\n      By accepting these Basic Terms, you understand and agree that you are entering into this Basic Agreement electronically and that certain categories of information (“Communications”) may be\n      provided by Even to you by electronic means (i.e., via email, through in-app notification, or to your mobile device), unless and until you withdraw your consent as described below. The categories\n      of Communications that may be provided by electronic means include:\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      (a) this Basic Agreement, Even’s Privacy Policy, and any other policies you agree to, and any amendments, modifications, or supplements to these agreements or policies.\n      (b) disclosures or notices provided in connection with the Services, including any required by applicable law.\n      (c) any customer service communications, including communications with respect to claims of error or unauthorized use of the Services; and\n      (d) any other communication related to the Services. Although Even reserves the right to provide Communications in paper format at any time, you agree that Even is under no obligation to do so.\n      All Communications in either electronic or paper format will be considered to be “in writing.”' You should print a paper copy of this Basic Agreement and any Communication that is important to\n      you and retain the copy for your records. If you do not wish to receive this Basic Agreement or the Communications electronically, you may not use the Services.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Timing of Communications. Any Communications will be deemed to have been received by you no later than 5 business days after Even sends it to you by email or in-app notification, whether or \n      not you have received the email or retrieved the Communication from the app. An electronic Communication by email or in-app notification is considered to be sent at the time that it is \n      directed by Even’s server to your email address or in-app inbox. You agree that these are reasonable procedures for sending and receiving electronic Communications.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Updated Contact Information. You agree to promptly update your Even account information if your email address changes so that Even may contact you electronically. You understand and agree\n      that if Even sends you an electronic Communication but you do not receive it because the email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, Even will be deemed to have provided the Communication to you.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      System Specifications. In order to access, view, and retain electronic Communications that Even makes available to you, you must have access to the following hardware and software requirements:\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>An Android or iOS mobile device (such as tablet or smart phone) with a data plan;</li>\n        <li>A connection to the Internet;</li>\n        <li>A Current Version of a program that accurately reads and displays PDF files, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader version 7 or higher. “Current Version” means a version of the software that is\n        currently being supported by its publisher; and</li>\n        <li>A printer to print out and save Communications in paper form or electronic storage to retain Communications in an electronic form.</li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>\n      Consent to Short Message Service (SMS) Communications. As part of your consent to electronic Communications, you agree to receive SMS messages to each telephone number provided by you to\n      Even regarding the Services. You understand that such SMS may be placed using an automatic telephone dialing system or may include automated SMS messages. Your consent is required to allow\n      Even to contact you and to use the Services. As always, you agree that you are responsible for any message, data rates or fees that your telephone service provider charges in relation to\n      SMS messages sent and received by you. If you have any questions regarding those rates, please contact your wireless carrier.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Requesting Paper Documents. You have a right to receive Communications in paper form. If, after you consent to receive Communications electronically, you would like a paper copy of a\n      Communication we previously sent you, you may request a copy within 180 days of the date we provided the Communication to you. Even will provide paper copies free of charge. Requests to\n      receive any paper copy may be made by mailing a written request to: Even Responsible Finance, Inc. 1440 Broadway, 5th Floor, Oakland CA 94612 You may also email your request\n      to support@teameven.com. We will provide a replacement Communication within fifteen (15) Business Days. In order for us to send you a paper copy of a Communication, you must have a \n      current street address on file in your Even account.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Withdrawal of Consent to Electronic Communications. If you have registered an account with Even and you wish to withdraw your consent to have Communications provided electronically, \n      you must stop using the services and deregister your Account by emailing Even at support@teameven.com or submitting a written request to: Even Responsible Finance, Inc. 1440 Broadway,\n      5th Floor, Oakland CA 94612 Even reserves the right to terminate your Even account if you withdraw consent to future electronic Communications. Any withdrawal of your consent to receive \n      electronic Communications will be effective only after Even has a reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal, which period of time shall be no longer than fifteen (15) days, or\n      such other time as is appropriate under the circumstances, as determined by Even in its sole discretion.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Withdrawal of Consent to SMS Communications. If you have registered an account with Even and you wish only to withdraw your consent to have Communications provided via SMS, you may \n      opt-out of receiving SMS from us at any time by texting the word 'STOP' to (510) 852-9149. You may also reply 'STOP' to any message you receive from us.' Upon receipt of your 'STOP'\n      message, we will send you a SMS message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed. At that point, you will no longer receive any further SMS messages from Even. If you need any assistance,\n      you can always text the word 'HELP' to (510) 852-9149 or reply “HELP” to any message you receive from us. Upon receipt of your “HELP message, we will respond with “STOP” instructions and \n      a link to these Basic Terms.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Reservation of Rights. Even reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to discontinue the provision of your electronic Communications, or to terminate or change the terms and conditions \n      on which Even provides electronic Communications. Even will provide you with notice of any such termination or change as required by law.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Warranty Disclaimer:</h2>\n      <p>\n      You release us from all liability for your having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We make no representations concerning any Content contained in or accessed \n      through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, or legality of material or Content contained in or accessed through the Services.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, \n      NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.\n      WE AND OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, PARTNERS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT: (I) THE SERVICES WILL BE SECURE OR AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; \n      (II) ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; (III) ANY CONTENT OR SOFTWARE AVAILABLE AT OR THROUGH THE SERVICES IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS; OR (IV) THE RESULTS \n      OF USING THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Not a Financial Planner</h2>\n      <p>\n      Neither Even nor the Personal Financial Management Service are intended to provide legal or financial advice. Even is not a financial planner. The Personal Financial Management \n      Service is intended only to assist you in your financial organization and decision-making and is broad in scope. Your personal financial situation is unique, and any information obtained\n      through or suggested by the Personal Financial Management Service may not be appropriate for your situation. Accordingly, before making any final decisions or implementing any financial \n      strategy, you should consider obtaining additional information and advice from your accountant or other financial advisers who are fully aware of your individual circumstances.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, Termination:</h2>\n      <p>\n      You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and each of our and their respective employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities,\n      claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that arise from or relate to your misuse of, or access to, the Services or Content, violation of these Basic Terms, or infringement \n      by you (or any third party using your Even account or identity in the Services) of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive\n      defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      IN NO EVENT SHALL WE, NOR OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR \n      EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, COMPENSATORY\n      OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (HOWEVER ARISING), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES\n      IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE OF) $500.00.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Governing Law and Jurisdiction:</h2>\n      <p>\n      These Basic Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States of America without regard to its conflicts of law rules. You agree that\n      any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Basic Terms shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts in Alameda County, California, or\n      federal court for the Northern District of California.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Arbitration:</h2>\n      <p>\n      PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Except as explicitly provided in this Basic Agreement, any dispute or claim (whether or not such dispute or claim involves a third party), relating in any way to your use of the Services,\n      Content, a product offered or provided by or through the Services, or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Basic Agreement, the Services or the Content that cannot be resolved directly\n      between you and Even shall be resolved by non-appearance based binding arbitration, rather than in court. Except as otherwise provided in this Basic Agreement, this includes any claims based \n      in contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Basic Agreement. There is no judge or jury\n      in arbitration and court review of an arbitration award is limited, but an arbitrator can award an individual the same damages and relief as a court and must apply and follow the terms of this \n      Basic Agreement as a court would. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Either you or we can initiate arbitration through the alternative dispute resolution provider the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) pursuant to the then-current Supplementary \n      Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the “Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation\n      shall be governed by the AAA rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration will take place in Alameda County, California unless the parties otherwise agree \n      in writing. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. If you and we cannot agree on who that single arbitrator should be, then the AAA shall appoint an arbitrator. If such costs\n      are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Even will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone or electronic means and/or shall be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner of which shall be chosen by the party initiating \n      the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is necessary based on the \n      request of one of the parties and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Even each agree that \n      any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather \n      than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial and agree to proceed only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. The parties hereby \n      appoint the arbitrator the exclusive power to rule on any challenges to the requirement for the use of alternative dispute resolution process in these Basic Terms.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to obtain interim or preliminary injunctive relief necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Even and all of its partners,\n      affiliates, shareholders, employees, and agents of any kind (together, our “Affiliates”).\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Except as explicitly provided in elsewhere in this Basic Agreement, all claims you bring against Even must be resolved in accordance with this Section. Any claim filed or brought contrary \n      to this Section may be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, Even may recover from you attorneys' fees and costs up to $1,500 per claim, provided\n      that Even first has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">Arbitration Restrictions:</h2>\n      <p>\n      You and Even agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute between Even and you individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with \n      any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any\n      dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this section \n      will be null and void. These arbitration provisions will survive the termination of your relationship with us.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration:\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      You and Even agree that the following disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any disputes seeking to enforce or protect, \n      or concerning the validity of, any of your or Even’s intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for injunctive relief.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"title is-5\">A few other miscellaneous things:</h2>\n      <p>\n      These Basic Terms represent the entire agreement between you and Even with respect to Even Basic. They supersede any other communications you have with us regarding the Even Basic, \n      such as by email or phone. If any part of these Basic Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, only that part will be removed or limited as needed, but the rest of these Basic \n      Terms will stay intact. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created under this Basic Agreement, and neither you nor Even has any authority to bind the \n      other in any way. The paragraph headings in these Basic Terms are for convenience only and do not affect any provision’s meaning or interpretation.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      All provisions of these Basic Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, \n      indemnity and limitations of liability.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Additionally, since Even is an application for iPhone, Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) requires that we post something they call their “Device and Application Basic Terms”. The most important thing \n      to know is that this Basic Agreement is an agreement between you and Even, not between you and Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Services or any application related to them, whether \n      accessed on a device provided by Apple or obtained through the Apple App Store (which application, in either case, will be referenced below as an “Application”). In addition:\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, \n        non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Basic Terms as they are applicable to the Services;</li>\n        <li>You will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device that you own or control;</li>\n        <li>You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application;</li>\n        <li>In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s sole\n        warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;</li>\n        <li>You acknowledge and agree that Even Responsible Finance, Inc., and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application;</li>\n        <li>You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property \n        rights, Even Responsible Finance, Inc., and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;</li>\n        <li>You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, \n        and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;</li>\n        <li>Both you and Even Responsible Finance, Inc. acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement whicct or \n        be affected by such use;h may affe and</li>\n        <li>Both you and Even Responsible Finance, Inc. acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Basic Terms, and that upon your acceptance \n        of these Basic Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Basic Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.</li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>\n      Also, this Basic Agreement is specific to the relationship between you and Even, so you cannot transfer any part of the Basic Agreement between you and Even to anyone else, or assign any part of\n      your relationship with Even to another person or organization. If, at some point, we fail to enforce any part of these Basic Terms, that does not mean we waive our rights to enforce this Basic \n      Agreement in the future. If we decide to make a special exception and waive your obligation to follow any part of these Basic Terms, we will notify you in writing.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Finally – sometimes we may need to change these Basic Terms. As an example, we might need to make changes if we add a new feature to Even. We will notify you by changing the revision date at the \n      top of this page, and in some cases we will notify you directly, by email or by in-app notification. Your continued use of Even Basic after a modification signifies your agreement to the modification.\n      We encourage you to frequently review these Basic Terms to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of Even Basic. We will always be happy to answer any questions \n      about these changes, and you can get in touch at support@even.com.\n      </p>\n      </section>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default PrivacyPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
